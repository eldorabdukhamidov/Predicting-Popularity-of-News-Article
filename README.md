## Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Capstone Project For Udacity

## Predicting popularity of news articles

In this project, you can be familiar with building and analysing three different classification algorithms to predict the popularity of news articles. This project gives explanation which model is good enough in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and AUC. The detailed information is given in report.pdf file.

## Dataset
 To have clear understanding about the dataset, you can find it using this [link](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity).

## Libraries utilized

- **NumPy** - a fundamental package for scientific computing in python
- **Pandas** - an ease-to-use python library for manipulating data structures and performing data analysis
- **Jupyter Notebook** - a tool that allows the creation of documents with live code
- **Matplotlib** - a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.
- **Sklearn** - a free software machine learning library
- **Toolkits** - collections of application-specific functions that extend Matplotlib
